Mossbook, the less political version of facebook, ***also not affiliated with meta.***

<h2 align="center">What Is This Mysterious Land?</h2>

Mossbook is a less political version of *facebook.com*, infact, politics of any kind is banned! We are just here to focus on what matters most to us, connecting with others.

<h2 align="center">Development</h2>

Development of mossbook started *August 6th, 2025*, and is estimated to take 1-2 years to fully complete V1 alone since this project is being developed and maintained by me, and there is only **ONE** me.

<h2 align="center">The Longterm Of This Project.</h2>

This project may not end up even finishing a V1, (whille I personally own/maintain it).Yeah thats sad, but its the truth! However whille im here working on it I will make sure to do as much as I can in a ***Timely Manner***.

<h2 align="center">Maintaining This.</h2>

Maintaining this project **WILL** be very expensive since I decided to use PHP for this. But that is why I will be implementing *ads* into this, So it can remain free, and stay up for as long as it can.
